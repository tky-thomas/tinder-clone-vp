### Setup

`tinder-clone` is the frontend component, `tinder-clone-backend` is the backend. The project database is initialized using sqlite in the backend under `src/database`.

To run the project please install `yarn`, then run the two stacks in separate terminals. Both projects follow the same installation and startup:
- Install project dependencies with `yarn install`
- Run the project with `yarn start`
